# Mario Heardle Infinite

Mario Heardle Infinite is a game that tests your knowledge of the Mario franchise's extensive musical library. Each day, a different song from across the whole franchise will be played and you have to identify what song it is from just a few seconds of it. Each guess adds a few more seconds of the song and there's an extensive hint system that provides helpful feedback to guide you to the right answer. Songs from Super Mario, Mario Kart, Mario & Luigi, Paper Mario, Mario Party, many of the Mario Sports games, Mario vs. Donkey Kong, Mario + Rabbids, Mario's Picross, Dr. Mario, Donkey Kong, Yoshi, Wario Land, WarioWare, Luigi's Mansion, Princess Peach, Captain Toad, remixes from the Super Smash Bros. series, various other games, as well as a few films and TV shows are all included. The library isn't yet a complete list of every Mario game ever made but you'd have to think hard to name a game that isn't here since even Mario no Photopi is included. The complete list of songs is available here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12vCtRU4cKzgTZk60kVveHRxQvdC2u0yS5pEISWeDlZo

Mario Heardle Infinite was started April 19th of 2024 as an addition to celebrate the 2 year anniversary of Mario Heardle. It was built off of Etrian Odyssey Heardle Infinite by Beigent0, which is a modified version of a Heardle template that can be traced back to WJSN Heardle, available here: https://github.com/jeroldcamacho/wjsn-heardle which was of course, a clone of the original Heardle which sadly was shut down by Spotify only 9 months after they bought it. I hope you enjoy it!
